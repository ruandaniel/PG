/*
after the kth input, for the ith one, we keep it with p = k/i
and randomly replace it with one in k selected item

Prove that the probability for each item to stay selected is k/i:
for i = k + 1:
	for the ith item to stay is p = k/i
	for the prev item to stay is p = 1 - (k/i) * (1/k) = (i-1)/i = k/i
for i = j + 1, j > k;
	assume that p(each item to stay when i = j) = k/j
	then for the j+1 item to stay is k/(j+1)
	for prev any item to stay is:
		p(already stayed) * p(not replaced)
	  = k/j * (1 - k/(j+1) * 1/k) = (k/jï¼‰* (j/j+1) = k/(j+1) = k/i
